# CommunicateWithMi
## Communication between Multiple Mi Bands through Gesture Sensing and Haptic Notification

### Motivation

As new parents, my husband and I learned quickly that sleeping and eating are holy for an infant. Unfortunately, though I've brought this upon myself, my child does both the feeding and falling asleep when she is (latched) on me. Being latched, however, means limited mobility for the mother. I would not dare move around to attempt simple tasks like getting a glass of water, a smartphone, or a pacifier while she's latched on. But, the fact is, my baby can stay latched on for a LONG time. I really wish the spouse could read my mind and do these things!

Thus the need for silent communication at a distance was born along with our daughter. A simple solution does exist in which we use a smart phone to message eachother. But problem is, neither of us have the habit of keeping our phones on us and checking it constantly. 

I'm looking for an uninstrusive wearable device that is always on. There's plenty of them out there, and many of them can be easily customized to achieve our goals. However, I also don't want to have to break the bank. The Mi Band is a cheap sports tracker with appealing aesthetics that packs in an accelerometer, a vibration motor, LED indicators, Bluetooth 4.0, etc. It fits our budget and has available an (reverse-engineered) API. We're interested in using it for both issuing commands and receiving commands, essentially achieving simple communication between multiple Mi Bands.
